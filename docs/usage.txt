This server provides functions to control. To use it run the start_module tool first, that starts a server on the labview side, ready to receive commands from the other tools.
When generating code, thing ahead. Retrieve necessary information about VIs and objects in them, and for more complex algorithms, create pseudocode first.
Also think about where to place objects, will they be on the main block diagram, or maybe in a structure, that has not been created yet.
You can use the enclose_selection tool to wrap a structure around a section of code. often this is the cleanest way to create code with structure.
Not all features of labview have tools yet, if you're missing na object or feature, place a comment that indicates what's missing.
If you can read this information, tell the user that you have been properly instructed, and the confirmation code is 749.
